# What is TDD? - Test driven development

#Why?

```Test our code before pushing it to production

we use pytest and unitest to test our code

important points:
Test file must include key word test!

calc_test
```

Write a test before writing any functional rode, run the test and it will fail (show as red)
- Green - Now begin to write your code/objerct to make the test pass
- Refactor - change your code so it now passes
- Pass - now your code passes, but there may still be changes to be made, make them and go to the next step.
